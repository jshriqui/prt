introduction: With Vitruvio, game designers or artists do not have to leave UE4 to make use of CityEngine’s procedural modeling power. The buildings stay procedural all time and artists can change the height, style and appearance of buildings easily with a parametric interface. In addition, buildings can also be generated at runtime.</br>As input Vitruvio requires rule packages (RPK) which are authored in CityEngine. An RPK includes assets and a CGA rule file which encodes an architectural style. The download section below provides links to the several RPKs which can be used out-of-the-box in Vitruvio.

  - title: New York
    text: This example features a part of New York. The building footprints are exported from CityEngine using <a href="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/cityengine/latest/help/cityengine-help-get-map-data.htm">Get Map Data</a>.</br></br>Notes&colon;</br><ul><li>The rules are from the International City example of CityEngine</li></ul>

  - title: Paris
    text: This example features buildings of Paris. Large parts of Paris were re-styled by Haussmann which earned the nickname the "Wall-City", because of continuous balconies running from facade to facade. The latter can be generated by selecting the higher level of detail.</br></br>Notes:</br><ul><li>The rules are from the Paris example of CityEngine</li></ul>
